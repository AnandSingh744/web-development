; This program reads in integers and adds them together
; until a negative number is read in.  Then it outputs
; the sum (not including the last number).

Start:	READ		; read n -> acc
        JUMPZ  Done  	; jump to Done if n < 0.
	ADD   sum  	; add sum to the acc
	STA sum 	; store the new sum
	JUMP  Start	; go back & read in next number
Done:	LDA  sum 	; load the final sum
	WRITE 		; write the final sum
	STOP  		; stop

sum:	.data 2 0 ; 2-byte location where sum is stored
